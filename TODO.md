* Don't save the sampled users in a TSV fileâ€”instead, use the uploaded list pages as the single source of truth
* Designate user talk *pages* instead of user names, so the entries on the wiki page link directly to those pages, saving time when spot checking the results of a message run
* Have the std_err output of a message run print the full target list URL so it's linked in the output
