This code was used to sample active and very active Wikimedia contributors to invite them to take a survey as part of the larger 2016-17 edition of the [Wikimedia Foundation performance survey](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Engagement_Insights/Performance).

In particular, it pulled a sample of users [stratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling) by the projects on which they were most active and posted the sample as a series of [MassMessage](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MassMessage) target lists on [Meta-wiki](https://meta.wikimedia.org) (for example, [meta:Community Engagement Insights/MassMessages/Lists/2016/42-VAEES](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Engagement_Insights/MassMessages/Lists/2016/42-VAEES)).
